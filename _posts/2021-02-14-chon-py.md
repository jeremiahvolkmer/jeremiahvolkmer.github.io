Use cron job to launch an app at a given time.

"Hello, This is a guide to set up "

Launch your app at a given time with a cron job on Linux. 

" This will be of use to someone who wants to run their app to run at a certain time of the day. For me I wanted a very simple box to pop-up everyday at 9:00 pm that reminded me to stand up and stretch for 15 minutes. I will be using Python3 and Crontab as my tools, but keep in mind there are other ways to accomplish this task. "

"The first step is to write the app, The code for my app is posted at the bottom if you would like to test with that(requires Gtk to be installed)."

"gi.require_version("Gtk", "3.0")
from gi.repository import Gtk

#
# Create a window object and sets size.
#
win = Gtk.Window()
win.set_border_width(24)
#
# Text to be displayed.
#
text = Gtk.Label("Stretch for 15 minutes")

#
# Sets title for the window.
# Add text to the window Object.
#
win.set_title("Dude!")
win.add(text)

win.connect("destroy", Gtk.main_quit) # Sets X icon to terminate program.
win.show_all()                        # Displays the window on the screen.
Gtk.main()                            # Starts the event loop.
